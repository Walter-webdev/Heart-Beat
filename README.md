# Heart-Beat
# Heart beat was made of pure HTML and CSS.
# Heart beat was created on the first day of my #100daysofcode excercise.
# Out of boredom I made the #heartbeat to celebrate love. 
# I used Vscode as my code editor.
# Also I used the git terminal in VScode to push to my gitHub remote storage.
